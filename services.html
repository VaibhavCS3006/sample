            <p>Sometimes legal costs are unavoidable, but they can be an unpleasant and unexpected expense. We cover all legal costs that may occur. So, if we need to evict a tenant or legally pursue a tenant for unpaid rent, we will do so without passing these costs on to you, the landlord. We manage the process professionally so that there is no disruption to your life or to your rental income.</p>
